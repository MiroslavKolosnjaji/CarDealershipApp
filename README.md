# CarDealershipApp
### Final course project - (client - server) application

This is a client/server desktop application developed as a final course exam project. The application is designed for a car dealership business.
Its purpose is to display the current status (available/sold) of all cars in the dealership's system.

Additionally, a search mechanism is implemented, allowing users to search for cars based on several criteria, such as brand, model,
chassis number, etc. There is also an option to create an order for a customer, where you can select a car and add additional equipment (if available).

Finally, the application provides a list of all orders.
If you're looking for a specific order, you donâ€™t need to scroll through the entire list; you can narrow the search by a specific date.
Each order displays details about the sold car, the salesperson who sold it, and the date of the sale.

## Technologies used
